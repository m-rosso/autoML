## AutoML

This project aims to explore some of the main **AutoML tools** available, which involves the following tasks:
1. Reading of technical articles concerning the automated machine learning field.
2. Discussion about machine learning pipelines and the automation of some of their components.
3. Identification of the most interesting Python libraries for automatic ML pipeline construction.
    * All the above tasks have led to the content available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/m-rosso/autoML/wiki/AutoML---Discussion) of this repository.

5. Quick implementation of the selected tools with simulated data.
    * This task implied in the notebook "*AutoML - Tutorials*", which presents briefly how to implement the selected AutoML tools.

7. Careful exploration of the APIs of the selected tools.
8. Comparison among selected tools concerning: model performance, computation time, and usability.
    * These tasks were carried out by the reading of APIs and the implementation of empirical tests that make use of the main functions and classes, initialization arguments, methods and attributes for each selected tool. The empirical tests rely on a series of notebooks named "AutoML - Empirical Tests".

All of these activities derive from the **objectives** of this project, which are: i) reflection about ML pipeline components; ii) discussion and analysis of AutoML tools; iii) identification of key-points of AutoML frameworks; iv) definition of: the advantages and disadvantages of main AutoML tools, and, first of all, the relavance and adequacy of implementing AutoML.
