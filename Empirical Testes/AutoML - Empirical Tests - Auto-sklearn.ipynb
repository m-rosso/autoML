The model assessment will be based on the following metrics, since the supervised learning task is a binary classification here: [ROC-AUC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html), [average precision score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html), [Brier score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.brier_score_loss.html), [accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html), and [MCC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef.html).\n","\n","* **Computation time:** all tested AutoML tools have some sort of time budget for the search process. Therefore, instead of minimizing the computation time across all tested tools, we will explore three different time budgets: 20 minutes, 1 hour, and 6 hours. Consequently, one of the main aspects of the comparison among tools will be the performance achieved by each one of them given different time budgets, besides of the average performance throughout all time budgets.\n","\n","* **Usability:** this aspect of the comparison refers to how easy it is to set up the search for each one of the tested tools. Also important are the outputs of the search process, mainly in terms of the visualization and assessment of constructed and selected pipelines. Besides, the diversity of produced information about the search and how clear it is to access and interpret these data are also an aspect to have in mind. Finally, the more straightforward it is to use a selected pipeline the better is the tool.\n","\n","The empirical tests follow the reading and discussing of the APIs of all selected tools. So, since the main initialization arguments, methods and attributes have been defined, they will be used accordingly in these notebooks.\n","\n","The data used for the empirical tests was found in Kaggle repository of datasets. It consists of a dataset for binary classification whose objective is to construct a classification algorithm for the [identification of malware apps](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/android-permission-dataset). It has 27310 unique instances (mobile phone applications) and 184 variables, among which one is the binary outcome variable and another is the name of the app. Since the main objective of this project is to explore AutoML tools, only some basic feature engineering operations were implemented, besides of a short description and exploration of the data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DYwz8EaYXFr4"},"source":["------------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o6klSsLAXFsI"},"source":["**Summary:**\n","1.
